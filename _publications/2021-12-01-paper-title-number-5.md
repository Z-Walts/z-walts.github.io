excerpt: 'Interventions that used individual contact and tailored the intervention to the occupational setting yielded the greatest effects on CVD risk-factor reduction in individuals working in blue-collar occupations. Generally, studies were low quality but showed promising effects for reaching this high-risk population. Future work should incorporate these promising findings in higher-quality studies.'
