collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2024-06-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Our findings indicate that metformin use is associated with a reduced risk of CRC in individuals with diabetes, including among those from predominantly low SES backgrounds. These results support previous epidemiological findings, and demonstrate that the protective association for metformin in relation to incident CRC likely generalizes to populations with higher underlying risk.'
